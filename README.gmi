# GEMINI-RB

Ruby parser and HTML viewer for the Gemini gemtext format.

The parser simply converts gemtext into blocks and can be used standalone for generating output.

The Sinatra based HTML viewer will embed images for viewing and add source code syntax highlighting. It also makes use of some annotations in the file to generate a web-based version of our issue tracker.

## Run webserver

We run Sinatra with Puma or standalone

=> .guix-deploy Puma/sinatra setup

Set up a Guix container (after installing GNU Guix)

```
source .guix-deploy
cd web
```

Run Sinatra

```
ruby app.rb -s Puma
```

or

```
puma -t 1 -e development
```

For production simply run puma.
