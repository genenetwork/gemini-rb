# GEMINI-RB

Ruby parser and HTML viewer for the Gemini gemtext format.

The parser simply converts gemtext into blocks and can be used standalone for generating output.

The HTML viewer will embed images for viewing and add source code syntax highlighting. It also makes use of some annotations in the file to generate a web-based version of our issue tracker.
